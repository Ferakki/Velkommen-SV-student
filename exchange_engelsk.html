		<h1>Welcome, exchange student!</h1>


		<p>You must be new here! This page will give you everything you need to get
		familiar with the exhange student program. As a new student, there will be
		arrangements and group activities hosted by the faculty or leading
		studentgroups who will help you. This page will cover some of the things you
		can look out for.</p>


		<h2>What the social science faculty offers</h2>


		<p>The faculty offers a selection of arrangements, studyhalls and cafees
		hosted by other students and administration on the faculty, which you as a
		exchange students can join in on. We know that information about these things
		can be overwhelming, so we made this website that gives you all the essential
		information you need to get familiar with the faculty. The following are some
		arrangements you as a exchange student can participate in before
		semesterstart.</p>


		<h2>Norwegian courses</h2>


		<p>The university offers norwegian courses for exchange students usually
		before the start of a semester. The course can be taken in July before
		autumn, and in December before spring semester. The courses offered have
		different degrees of difficulty, and one has to pass the previous before
		moving on to next. Read more about the different <a href=

		<h2>Mentorweek</h2>


		<p>Also called sponsor week, is a full week dedicated for students to get to
		know each other. Usually during the first week of the semester, the week
		consists of arrangements, parties and activities ranging from bar to bar,
		quizzes, physical activities, and clubs. Bringing alcohol is of course
		optional and is not a necessity to get to know each other. Getting to know
		each other during this week is crucial that you can support each other during
		the semester.</p>
